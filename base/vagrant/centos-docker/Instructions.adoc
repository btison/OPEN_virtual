# Introduction

The `centos-docker` project allows to create a Virtual Machine using `Vagrant` as VM Tool and `VirtualBox` to run the Virtual Machine created from the `Vagrantfile` file.
The virtual machine is a CentOS 7.1 Linux Operationg System that we will provision with OpenJDK 8, Apache Maven 3.2.3 and docker daemon/client.
A DNS server will be configured on your host machine to simplify the access to the services running within the host machine. It is created using the `Vagrant landrush` plugin and run on your
 host on the port 10053.

As depicted within the following diagam, 2 networks adapters have bee configured; one using NAT and the other using the Host Only Adpter of VirtualBox. The NAT adapter will used to ssh the machine using this
command `ssh vagrant@localhost -p 2222` from the host to guest while the provate network will help you to access the docker daemon or docker processes exposed using the address 172.128.28.1

# Setup Vagrant

Follow the instructions described on the https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/[Vagrant web site] in order to install Vagrant Tool

# Create the Virtual Machine

In order to use the virtual machine created by Vagrant with theVirtualbox provider, it is required that you follow these instructions

. Download the `OPEN_virtual` https://github.com/redhat-gpe/OPEN_virtual/archive/master.zip[project] or git https://github.com/redhat-gpe/OPEN_virtual.git[clone it].
. Next, create a directory from where you will use Vagrant to create the Virtual Machine

    mkdir centos-docker
    cd centos-docker

. Copy/paste the `Vagrantfile` and launch Vagrant

    cp /path/to/OPEN_virtual/base/vagrant/centos-docker/Vagrantfile/Vagrantfile .
    vagrant up

# SSH to the guest machine

    vagrant ssh

TIP: The user/password to be used is `vagrant/vagrant`

# Access Docker daemon fro mthe host

In order to access the guest machine from the host machine, an ENV variable must be created with the ip address or hostname of the docker daemon.

    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.28.128.4:2375

The version of the docker daemon deployed deployed is `1.9.1`. This is why we recommend that you install on your host the docker client 1.9.1.

Here are the instructions to follow to install it

[source]
----
wget https://get.docker.com/builds/Darwin/x86_64/docker-1.9.1
mv docker-1.9.1 docker
chmod +x docker
----

Next, move it to bin directory which is included within your PATH. Check if you can access the docker daemon and get information

    docker version
